# Mod-installer
A Minecraft launcher modpack installer for Linux. This is made for the default Minecraft launcher. Main purpose is to make it easier for less technical people easily install modpacks from a git release instead of manually installing.

# Why?
I don't know I was bored and wanted to update this dead project to be actually functional
